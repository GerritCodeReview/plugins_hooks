# Supported Hooks

[TOC]

## Synchronous Hooks

These hooks are invoked synchronously so it is recommended that they not block.

A default timeout on the hook is set to 30 seconds to avoid "runaway" hooks using
up server threads.  The timeout can be changed by setting [`hooks.syncHookTimeout`][1].

### ref-update

This is called when a ref update request (direct push, non-fastforward update, or
ref deletion) is received by Gerrit. It allows a request to be rejected before it
is committed to the Gerrit repository.

If the hook exits with non-zero return code the update will be rejected. Any output
from the hook will be returned to the user, regardless of the return code.

```
  ref-update --project <project name> --refname <refname> --uploader <uploader> --uploader-username <username> --oldrev <sha1> --newrev <sha1>
```

### commit-received

This is called when a commit is received for review by Gerrit. It allows a push to
be rejected before the review is created.

If the hook exits with non-zero return code the push will be rejected. Any output
from the hook will be returned to the user, regardless of the return code.

```
  commit-received --project <project name> --refname <refname> --uploader <uploader> --uploader-username <username> --oldrev <sha1> --newrev <sha1> --cmdref <refname>
```

### submit

This is called when a user attempts to submit a change. It allows the submit to
be rejected.

If the hook exits with non-zero return code the submit will be rejected and the
ouput from the hook will be returned to the user.

```
  submit --project <project name> --branch <branch> --submitter <submitter> --patchset <patchset id> --commit <sha1>
```

## Asynchronous Hooks

These hooks are invoked asynchronously on a background thread.
